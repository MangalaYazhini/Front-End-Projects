### What I Learned

While working on this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Centering elements using Flexbox
- Handling responsive layouts with `min-height` and `clamp()`
- Managing overflow and viewport height issues
- Structuring reusable CSS classes

Example CSS I’m proud of:

```css
.profile_div {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
  border-radius: 5px;
}
